### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | Next.js 16.1.6 (not 14) | Latest stable, satisfies "14+" requirement |
| 01-01 | Tailwind CSS v4 | Ships with latest create-next-app; uses CSS-based config (@import "tailwindcss") not tailwind.config.ts |
| 01-01 | Package name "swmrha" (lowercase) | npm naming restriction on uppercase directory names |

### Deferred Issues

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Plan 01-02 must account for Tailwind v4 config model (CSS @theme directive, not tailwind.config.ts)
