**Tech stack available:** Next.js 16.1.6, Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript, @heroicons/react
**Established patterns:**
- Hero sections: 400px height, full-bleed Image, dark gradient
- Navy-900/navy-800 backgrounds, gold-500 accents
- Clickable phone/email: tel: and mailto: protocols (from Phase 5)
- Card layouts with border-gold-500/20
- Icon decoration for section headings

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 03-02: Clickable phone/email as tel:/mailto: links for mobile UX
- Phase 05-02: Tel: protocol for phones enables one-tap calling

**Sponsors data:** 11 sponsors across Platinum/Diamond/Gold/Silver/Bronze tiers, signup URL, 7 sponsorship levels with benefits
**Contact data:** 7 officers with phone/email/roles, mailing address, Facebook link

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build sponsors page with tier-organized layout</name>
  <files>src/app/sponsors/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create /sponsors page with three main sections:

1. Hero section: Standard 400px hero with images.events.hero1, "Our Sponsors" heading, intro text from sponsors.intro

2. Sponsors grid (tier-organized):
   - Group sponsors by level (Platinum, Diamond, Gold, Silver, Bronze)
   - Each tier section: tier name as heading-3, grid of sponsor logos
   - Sponsor cards: border-gold-500/20, rounded-lg, p-6, contain sponsor logo (Next.js Image), name, clickable link if URL exists
   - Logo sizing: Platinum larger (h-32), Diamond/Gold (h-24), Silver/Bronze (h-20) - reflects tier hierarchy
   - Grid: 3 columns desktop (lg:grid-cols-3), 2 tablet (md:grid-cols-2), 1 mobile
   - Logos as links: if sponsor.url exists, wrap in Link with target="_blank", show ExternalLinkIcon on hover
   - Background: navy-900 for hero, navy-800 for sponsors section

3. Become a Sponsor CTA section:
   - Centered content with intro text and SignUpGenius link
   - Gold button to signupUrl with target="_blank"
   - Background: navy-900
   - Use HeartIcon from @heroicons for decoration

4. Sponsorship Levels section:
   - Display all sponsorLevels from data
   - Each level as card: name, amount, benefits list
   - Border color varies by level name (Platinum: gold-500, others: gold-500/50)
   - Grid: 2 columns desktop (lg:grid-cols-2), 1 mobile

SEO metadata: title "Sponsors | SMRHA", description "Thank you to our sponsors..."
  </action>
  <verify>npm run dev, visit http://localhost:3000/sponsors, verify 11 sponsors grouped by tier, signup button links correctly, sponsorship levels display</verify>
  <done>Sponsors page complete with hero, tier-organized sponsor grid showing all 11 sponsors with logos/links, become-a-sponsor CTA, sponsorship levels section; mobile responsive</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create contact page with officer cards and contact methods</name>
  <files>src/app/contact/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create /contact page with four sections:

1. Hero section: Standard hero (images.events.hero1), "Contact Us" heading, subtitle from contact.subtitle

2. Officers & Board Members section:
   - Grid of officer cards: 3 columns desktop (lg:grid-cols-3), 2 tablet (md:grid-cols-2), 1 mobile
   - Map over contact.officers array
   - Each card: UserCircleIcon placeholder (no photos available - same as Phase 3), name, role, phone (if exists), email (if exists)
   - Phone as clickable tel: link: `<a href="tel:${phone}">...</a>` with PhoneIcon
   - Email as clickable mailto: link: `<a href="mailto:${email}">...</a>` with EnvelopeIcon
   - Card styling: bg-navy-800, border-gold-500/20, rounded-lg, p-6
   - Section background: navy-900
   - Heading decoration: UsersIcon from @heroicons

3. Mailing Address section:
   - Display contact.mailingAddress (name, address, city/state/zip)
   - Icon: EnvelopeIcon
   - Background: navy-800
   - Formatted address block with proper line breaks

4. Connect With Us section:
   - Display social media links (Facebook)
   - Facebook link with target="_blank", icon decoration
   - Note: "Follow us for updates and photos from our events"
   - Background: navy-900
   - Use share icon or Facebook icon representation

SEO metadata: title "Contact Us | SMRHA", description "Get in touch with SMRHA officers..."

DO NOT create a contact form - officers have clickable email/phone links which serve the same purpose without backend complexity for MVP.
  </action>
  <verify>Visit http://localhost:3000/contact, verify 7 officer cards display with clickable phone/email links, mailing address formatted correctly, Facebook link works</verify>
  <done>Contact page complete with hero, 7 officer cards with clickable tel:/mailto: links, mailing address section, social media link; all contact methods functional; mobile responsive</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add primary contact callout and final polish</name>
  <files>src/app/contact/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Polish contact page with additional helpful sections:

1. Primary Contact callout (above officers grid):
   - Highlighted card featuring contact.primaryContact (Jeromy Lipps - President)
   - Larger card with gold-500 border (not /20 opacity), centered
   - Display: name, role, phone (tel: link), email (mailto: link)
   - Use StarIcon or UserIcon for decoration
   - Background: navy-800
   - Purpose: Make it immediately clear who to contact for general inquiries

2. Quick Contact section (between hero and officers):
   - Brief intro: "Need help? Have questions about membership or shows?"
   - Two-column layout on desktop: Email (EnvelopeIcon) and Phone (PhoneIcon) quick links to primary contact
   - Background: navy-900, border-gold-500/20, rounded-lg

Verify all links work:
- All tel: links should be properly formatted (no spaces in href, display can have formatting)
- All mailto: links open email client
- External links have target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer"
- Proper icon sizing (w-5 h-5 for inline icons, w-8 h-8 for section decorations)
  </action>
  <verify>Primary contact card stands out visually, quick contact section provides immediate access to president's contact info, all phone/email links functional</verify>
  <done>Contact page fully polished with primary contact callout, quick contact section, all tel:/mailto: links functional, proper icon usage, responsive layout complete</done>
