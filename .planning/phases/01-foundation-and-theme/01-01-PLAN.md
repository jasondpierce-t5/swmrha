<objective>
Initialize the Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and App Router, establishing the directory structure for all future pages.

Purpose: Create the buildable project foundation that all subsequent phases depend on.
Output: A running Next.js app with `npm run dev` working, TypeScript configured, Tailwind operational, and App Router page stubs for every site section.

**Tech stack (from PROJECT.md):** Next.js 14+ (App Router), Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
**Deployment target:** Vercel (static export for MVP)
**Content approach:** Static data files, no API routes needed for v1

**Navigation structure (from Wix site analysis):**
- Home
- About
- Shows & Events (Show Schedule, Results & Standings)
- Membership (Join SWMRHA, Rules & Classes, Green as Grass)
- Resources (Find a Trainer, FAQ)
- Gallery
- Sponsors
- Contact

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Next.js 14+ project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS</name>
  <files>package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.mjs, next.config.ts, src/app/layout.tsx, src/app/page.tsx, src/app/globals.css</files>
  <action>
  Initialize a Next.js 14+ project in the repo root using `npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*" --use-npm`. Use the `--yes` flag or answer prompts non-interactively. If the directory already has files (like .planning/, currentsite/), create the Next.js project so it coexists — do NOT delete existing directories.

  After creation, verify the generated files exist and `npm run dev` starts without errors. Stop the dev server after confirming.

  Do NOT customize the theme yet (that's Plan 01-02). Just confirm Tailwind is wired up by checking that `globals.css` has the `@tailwind` directives and `tailwind.config.ts` has the `content` paths set.

  <verify>npm run build succeeds with zero errors</verify>
  <done>Next.js app builds successfully, package.json has next/react/typescript/tailwindcss dependencies, tailwind.config.ts exists with content paths, App Router layout.tsx and page.tsx exist in src/app/</done>

  <action>
  Create page.tsx stubs for every route in the site navigation. Each stub should be a simple exported default function component that returns an h1 with the page name, wrapped in a main element. This establishes the routing structure for all future phases.

  Route structure:
  - /about → "About SWMRHA"
  - /shows → "Shows & Events" (index/landing)
  - /shows/schedule → "Show Schedule"
  - /shows/results → "Results & Standings"
  - /membership → "Membership" (index/landing)
  - /membership/join → "Join SWMRHA"
  - /membership/rules → "Rules & Classes"
  - /membership/green-as-grass → "Green as Grass Buckle Program"
  - /resources/faq → "Frequently Asked Questions"
  - /resources/find-a-trainer → "Find a Trainer"
  - /gallery → "Gallery"
  - /sponsors → "Sponsors"
  - /contact → "Contact"

  Each stub follows this pattern:
  ```tsx
  export default function PageName() {
    return (
      <main>
        <h1>Page Title</h1>
      </main>
    );
  }
  ```

  Do NOT add styling or content — just establish the route tree.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds; verify each route exists by checking the build output lists all pages</verify>
  <done>All 13 page routes created and build succeeds with all pages listed in output. Navigating to any route in dev server shows the page title.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] All 13+ page routes exist in build output
- [ ] `src/app/layout.tsx` exists with root layout
- [ ] `tailwind.config.ts` has correct content paths
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors

<success_criteria>

- Next.js 14+ project initialized with App Router
- TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint configured
- All page stubs created matching site navigation structure
- Build succeeds with zero errors
