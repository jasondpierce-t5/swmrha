**Established patterns:**
- Hero section: full-bleed Image with dark gradient overlay, centered heading and subtitle
- Content sections: alternating bg-navy-800/bg-navy-900 for visual rhythm
- Typography: text-heading-1/2 classes for headings, text-slate-300 for body
- Icons from @heroicons/react/24/outline for visual interest
- External links: target="_blank" with rel="noopener noreferrer"
- Metadata for SEO

**Available content (membership.ts):**
- Join heading, intro, form URL, mail-in address
- NRHA pattern book link
- "What is Reining" explanation
- Breed info Q&A
- "Is reining for me?" content

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build Membership/Join page</name>
  <files>src/app/membership/join/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Create complete /membership/join page following Phase 3-4 patterns. Include: (1) Hero section with hero image (images.events.hero2 or similar), heading "Join SMRHA", subtitle from joinIntro; (2) Primary section with joinHeading, online form link (membershipFormUrl), and mail-in option with address formatted cleanly; (3) "What is Reining" section with whatIsReining text, breed Q&A (breedInfoQuestion/breedInfo), and "Is it for me?" Q&A; (4) NRHA Pattern Book section with download link. Use UserCircleIcon or DocumentTextIcon for section headers. Follow Shows page pattern for structure and styling. Add metadata for SEO.</action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, /membership/join renders with all sections, external links open in new tabs, content matches membership.ts</verify>
  <done>Join page complete with hero, membership form links, reining info, and NRHA resources</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Build Rules & Classes page</name>
  <files>src/app/membership/rules/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Create /membership/rules page. Include: (1) Hero section with heading "Rules & Classes", subtitle about NRHA affiliation; (2) Introduction section explaining SMRHA follows NRHA rules; (3) Resources section with prominent cards/links to: NRHA Handbook (https://nrha.com/handbook), NRHA Pattern Book (nrhaPatternBookUrl from membership.ts), NRHA website (http://nrha1.com/). Use BookOpenIcon or ScaleIcon for visual interest. Keep it concise - this is primarily a resource gateway page, not heavy content. Follow established styling patterns. Add metadata.</action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, /membership/rules renders with hero and resource links, all external links functional</verify>
  <done>Rules page complete with NRHA resource links and clean layout</done>
</task>
