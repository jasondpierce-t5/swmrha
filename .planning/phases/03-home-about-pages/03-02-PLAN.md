@.planning/phases/02-content-extraction/02-01-SUMMARY.md

# Source files for this plan:
@src/app/globals.css
@src/app/about/page.tsx
@src/data/about.ts

**Tech stack available:**
- Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-based @theme config)
- @heroicons/react
- next/font/google (Montserrat + Inter)

**Established patterns:**
- Tailwind v4 inline @theme tokens in globals.css
- Typography classes: .text-display, .text-heading-1/2/3 (composite font properties)
- Always-dark mode (no light theme)
- Navy/gold/teal color palette
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Typed data imports from src/data/

**Constraining decisions:**
- Always-dark mode - site never switches to light theme
- Montserrat + Inter typography - use established .text-* classes
- Mobile-first responsive - test on 375px, 768px, 1024px+
- Navy background (bg-navy-900), gold accents (text-gold-500)
- NO BOARD MEMBER PHOTOS AVAILABLE - about.ts comment explicitly states "No individual board member photos were found in the Wix site media"

**Issues being addressed:** None

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create mission and history section</name>
  <files>src/app/about/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Replace the page stub with mission/history section:
    - Page title "About SMRHA" using .text-display text-gold-500, pt-24 pb-12 (accounts for fixed header)
    - Container: max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6
    - Section heading "Our Mission" in .text-heading-1 text-white pb-6
    - Map mission array from about.ts (2 paragraphs) with .text-lg text-white/90 leading-relaxed, gap-4 between paragraphs
    - Below mission: openInvitation from about.ts in bg-navy-800 border-l-4 border-teal-500 p-6 mt-8 italic text-white/80
    - Contact info section: "Get In Touch" heading (.text-heading-2 text-gold-500 pt-12 pb-4)
    - Display contactInfo.name, contactInfo.phone, contactInfo.role from about.ts
    - Phone as clickable link: tel:{phone}, styled text-teal-400 hover:text-teal-300
    - DO NOT add fabricated content - use only mission, openInvitation, contactInfo from about.ts
    - DO NOT use light mode styles - always dark background
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, /about page loads, mission displays 2 paragraphs, contact phone is clickable tel: link</verify>
  <done>Mission section displays with page title, 2 mission paragraphs, invitation callout, contact info with clickable phone link, all styled correctly, build succeeds</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create board members section</name>
  <files>src/app/about/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Below mission section, create board/leadership section:
    - Section heading "Friends of the SMRHA" in .text-heading-1 text-white pt-16 pb-6 (matches Wix label from about.ts comment)
    - Explanatory text: "Our dedicated supporters and board members" in text-white/70 pb-8
    - Map boardMembers array from about.ts as a simple list (NO PHOTOS - comment in about.ts confirms none available)
    - Each member: bg-navy-800 rounded-lg p-4 border border-navy-600, display member.name in text-white font-semibold
    - Grid layout: grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4
    - DO NOT add placeholder photos or avatar circles - about.ts explicitly states no photos exist
    - DO NOT add roles if member.role is undefined - boardMembers array has no role field
    - Keep design simple and text-focused since no images available
  </action>
  <verify>Board members display in 1 column mobile, 2 columns desktop, 4 members shown, no photo placeholders, styled cards</verify>
  <done>Board members section displays "Friends of the SMRHA" heading, 4 members from about.ts in responsive grid, no photos (per data file), clean card design, build succeeds</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete About page with mission/history and board members sections</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Visit: http://localhost:3000/about
    3. Desktop (>1024px): Verify readable text layout, 2-column board member grid
    4. Tablet (768px): Verify 2-column board members
    5. Mobile (375px): Verify 1-column board members, text remains readable
    6. Check: Page title "About SMRHA" displays in gold
    7. Check: Mission has 2 paragraphs, invitation callout has teal border
    8. Check: Contact phone link is clickable (opens tel: on mobile)
    9. Check: "Friends of the SMRHA" section shows 4 members with NO photos (correct per data)
    10. Check: No horizontal scroll, navy/gold/teal color scheme consistent
