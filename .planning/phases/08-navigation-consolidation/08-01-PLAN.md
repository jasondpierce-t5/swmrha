<objective>
Streamline navigation menu structure by reorganizing dropdowns, removing demo links from public nav, fixing broken results routing, and aligning footer with new information architecture.

Purpose: Current nav has an overloaded "About" dropdown (5 unrelated items), a board demo link in the public Membership menu, and a broken results link pointing to a placeholder page. This phase creates a cleaner, more intuitive IA.
Output: Reorganized header nav, updated footer, fixed results routing — all consistent across desktop and mobile.

**Tech stack available:** Next.js 16.1.6, Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript, App Router
**Established patterns:** Navigation driven by `src/lib/navigation.ts` array consumed by Header.tsx and MobileMenu.tsx. Footer has independent hardcoded links.

**Current navigation structure (problems highlighted):**
```
Home
Shows ▼ → Schedule, Results (/shows/results — BROKEN placeholder), Gallery
Membership ▼ → Join, Rules, Green as Grass, Demo (Online Payments) — DEMO SHOULDN'T BE PUBLIC
About ▼ → About Us, Find a Trainer, Sponsors, FAQ, Contact — OVERLOADED (5 unrelated items)
```

**Target navigation structure:**
```
Home
Shows ▼ → Show Schedule, Results & Standings (/results — actual page), Gallery
Membership ▼ → Join SWMRHA, Rules & Classes, Green as Grass
Resources ▼ → Find a Trainer, Sponsors, FAQ
About (top-level link, no dropdown)
Contact (top-level link, no dropdown)
[Join CTA button]
```

**Key changes:**
1. Split "About" dropdown → top-level "About" + new "Resources" dropdown + top-level "Contact"
2. Remove "Demo (Online Payments)" from Membership dropdown (pages stay, just not in public nav)
3. Fix Results link: `/shows/results` → `/results` (where real content lives)
4. Replace `/shows/results/page.tsx` placeholder with redirect to `/results`

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Restructure navigation config and fix results routing</name>
  <files>src/lib/navigation.ts, src/app/shows/results/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update `src/lib/navigation.ts` navigation array to new structure:
- Home: href "/" (unchanged)
- Shows dropdown: children = Show Schedule (/shows/schedule), Results & Standings (/results), Gallery (/gallery). Set parent href to "/shows"
- Membership dropdown: children = Join SWMRHA (/membership/join), Rules & Classes (/membership/rules), Green as Grass (/membership/green-as-grass). Remove "Demo (Online Payments)" item. Set parent href to "/membership"
- Resources dropdown (NEW): href "/resources", children = Find a Trainer (/resources/find-a-trainer), Sponsors (/sponsors), FAQ (/resources/faq)
- About: top-level link, href "/about", NO children array
- Contact: top-level link, href "/contact", NO children array

Replace `src/app/shows/results/page.tsx` placeholder with a redirect to `/results` using Next.js `redirect()` from `next/navigation`. This ensures any bookmarked or cached links to `/shows/results` still work.

Do NOT modify Header.tsx or MobileMenu.tsx — they already consume the navigation array dynamically and will reflect changes automatically.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify no TypeScript errors. Confirm navigation.ts exports correct structure by visual inspection.</verify>
  <done>navigation.ts has 6 top-level items (Home, Shows, Membership, Resources, About, Contact). No demo link in nav. Results points to /results. /shows/results redirects to /results.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update footer links to match new navigation structure</name>
  <files>src/components/Footer.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update Footer.tsx columns to align with new IA:

Column 1 (SWMRHA branding): No changes needed.

Column 2 (Quick Links): Update to match primary nav destinations:
- Home (/)
- About (/about)
- Shows & Events (/shows/schedule)
- Results (/results) — add this, was missing
- Gallery (/gallery)

Column 3 (Membership & Resources): Merge membership + resources:
- Join SWMRHA (/membership/join)
- Rules & Classes (/membership/rules)
- Green as Grass (/membership/green-as-grass)
- Find a Trainer (/resources/find-a-trainer)
- Sponsors (/sponsors)

Column 4 (Contact): Keep as-is:
- Contact Us (/contact)
- FAQ (/resources/faq)
- Email link
- Location text

Do NOT change footer layout structure, styling, social icons, or bottom bar.
  </action>
  <verify>Run `npm run build` — build succeeds with no errors. Visually inspect footer changes in build output.</verify>
  <done>Footer links match new nav IA. All 4 columns updated. Build passes. No broken links.</done>

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Desktop (>1024px): Verify header shows Home, Shows ▼, Membership ▼, Resources ▼, About, Contact, [Join]
    3. Click Shows dropdown: Verify Show Schedule, Results & Standings, Gallery appear
    4. Click Membership dropdown: Verify Join, Rules, Green as Grass appear (NO demo link)
    5. Click Resources dropdown: Verify Find a Trainer, Sponsors, FAQ appear
    6. Click About and Contact: Verify they navigate directly (no dropdown)
    7. Click Results & Standings: Verify it goes to /results with real content
    8. Visit /shows/results directly: Verify it redirects to /results
    9. Mobile (resize to <1024px): Open hamburger menu, verify same structure with expandable sections
    10. Scroll to footer: Verify columns reflect new navigation structure
