   - Extract exact text from HTML — do not paraphrase

Import types from `./types` (Sponsor, Trainer from Plan 02-01's types.ts). Add any new types needed to types.ts.
  </action>
  <verify>`npm run build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors</verify>
  <done>src/data/sponsors.ts has all sponsor names and image references, src/data/trainers.ts has 5 trainers with details, src/data/green-as-grass.ts has full program description and 5 rules — all from real HTML content</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Extract contact info, venue data, and create content index</name>
  <files>src/data/contact.ts, src/data/venue.ts, src/data/index.ts</files>
  <action>
1. Create `src/data/contact.ts` — read `currentsite/moreininghorseassc.wixsite.com/momrha/form-map.html` and home page content, extract:

   - `relatedOrgs`: [{ name: "Kansas Reining Horse Association", url: "https://www.kansasreining.com" }, { name: "Missouri Quarter Horse Association", url: "https://www.MQHA.com" }]

3. Create `src/data/index.ts` — barrel export file:
   - Re-export everything from all data files for convenient imports
   - Export all types from types.ts
   - This becomes the single import point: `import { homeContent, faqs, sponsors } from '@/data'`

After creating all files, verify the content is correctly typed by running a build.
  </action>
  <verify>`npm run build` succeeds with no errors</verify>
  <done>src/data/contact.ts has contact details and social links, src/data/venue.ts has venue and stall info, src/data/index.ts re-exports all data — full data layer complete</done>
</task>
