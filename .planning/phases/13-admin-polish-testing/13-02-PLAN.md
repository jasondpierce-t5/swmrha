<objective>
Add success feedback notifications to admin list pages and finalize the admin dashboard.

Purpose: After CRUD operations, users currently see no confirmation that their action succeeded — they're just redirected to the list page. This plan adds visible success banners and finalizes the dashboard for production readiness.
Output: All 3 admin list pages with green success banners reading URL search params, finalized dashboard without placeholder content.

# Source files to modify:
@src/app/admin/shows/page.tsx
@src/app/admin/sponsors/page.tsx
@src/app/admin/results/page.tsx
@src/app/admin/page.tsx

**Established patterns:**
- Admin list pages are Server Components fetching data via server actions
- Navy/gold styling with western-professional aesthetic
- Dashboard uses content summary cards with icon + count + "Manage" link
- Error display: red border/background alert box

**From Plan 13-01:**
- Server action redirects now include `?success=created|updated|deleted` query params
</context>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add success notification banners to admin list pages</name>
  <files>src/app/admin/shows/page.tsx, src/app/admin/sponsors/page.tsx, src/app/admin/results/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add success feedback banners to all 3 admin list pages that read the `success` URL search param set by Plan 13-01's server action redirects.

**Implementation pattern (same for all 3 pages):**

1. Accept `searchParams` in the page component props (Next.js 16 async pattern: `{ searchParams }: { searchParams: Promise<{ success?: string }> }`). Await searchParams.

2. Map success param values to messages:
   - "created" → "Show created successfully" / "Sponsor created successfully" / "Result created successfully"
   - "updated" → "Show updated successfully" / etc.
   - "deleted" → "Show deleted successfully" / etc.

3. Render success banner ABOVE the table/content when success param present:
   ```
   <div className="rounded-lg border border-green-700 bg-green-900/20 p-4 mb-6">
     <p className="text-sm text-green-400">{successMessage}</p>
   </div>
   ```
   Style mirrors existing error display pattern but with green colors instead of red.

4. No JavaScript needed for dismissal — banner naturally disappears on next navigation since it's tied to the URL param. Keep it simple.

Do NOT create a separate SuccessBanner component — the pattern is 5-6 lines inline per page and creating a component for this is over-engineering.

Do NOT add client-side auto-dismiss timers — the server-rendered banner is cleared naturally on next navigation.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build passes. Navigate to /admin/shows?success=created in browser and verify green banner appears with "Show created successfully" message.</verify>
  <done>All 3 admin list pages show green success banners when redirected after create/edit/delete operations. Banners use consistent green styling mirroring existing red error pattern.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Finalize admin dashboard</name>
  <files>src/app/admin/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Polish the admin dashboard page:

1. **Remove "Recent Activity" placeholder section** — it says "Recent activity tracking coming soon" which is not planned for v1.1. Remove the entire placeholder section cleanly.

2. **Ensure summary cards are final:**
   - Verify Shows, Sponsors, Results cards display accurate live counts
   - Verify "Manage" links point to correct admin routes
   - Verify icons are appropriate (CalendarIcon for Shows, BuildingStorefrontIcon for Sponsors, TrophyIcon for Results)

3. **Quick actions section:**
   - Verify all quick action buttons work (Add Show, Add Sponsor, Update Results)
   - Ensure consistent button styling

4. **Final consistency check:**
   - Verify page title and welcome message display correctly
   - Ensure responsive grid works (1 col mobile, 2 cols tablet, 3 cols desktop)
   - Remove any TODO comments or placeholder text

Do NOT add new features (search, bulk ops, export) — those are beyond v1.1 scope. This is polish only.
