<objective>
Verify production build and conduct comprehensive acceptance testing of all admin features.

Purpose: Final quality gate before declaring v1.1 complete. Ensures all admin CRUD flows work end-to-end, validation catches errors, success feedback displays, and the build is deployment-ready.
Output: Verified build, comprehensive manual testing of all admin features.

  <name>Task 1: Full production build verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run comprehensive build verification:

1. Run `npm run build` — must complete with zero errors and zero warnings (TypeScript, ESLint)
2. Run `npx next lint` — must pass with no errors
3. Verify all admin routes are included in build output (check for /admin, /admin/shows, /admin/sponsors, /admin/results, and their sub-routes)
4. Check build output for any pages that failed to compile

If any errors found, fix them before proceeding to the checkpoint.

Do NOT add new test scripts or test frameworks — manual acceptance testing via checkpoint is appropriate for this admin panel scope.

  <what-built>Complete v1.1 admin management system with validated forms, success feedback, and polished dashboard</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: `npm run dev`
    2. Visit: http://localhost:3000/login — log in with admin credentials

    **Dashboard (http://localhost:3000/admin):**
    3. Verify summary cards show correct counts for Shows, Sponsors, Results
    4. Verify no placeholder or "coming soon" sections
    5. Click each "Manage" link — verify navigation works
    6. Click each quick action button — verify navigation works

    **Shows CRUD (http://localhost:3000/admin/shows):**
    7. Click "Add Show" → fill form → submit → verify green success banner "Show created successfully"
    8. Edit the show you just created → change a field → save → verify green "Show updated successfully"
    9. Try submitting with empty required fields → verify browser-native validation prevents submission
    10. Delete the test show → confirm → verify green "Show deleted successfully"

    **Sponsors CRUD (http://localhost:3000/admin/sponsors):**
    11. Create a sponsor with logo upload → verify success banner
    12. Edit the sponsor → change level → save → verify success banner
    13. Try entering invalid URL (e.g., "not-a-url") in website field → verify validation rejects it
    14. Delete test sponsor → verify success banner

    **Results CRUD (http://localhost:3000/admin/results):**
    15. Create a result → verify success banner
    16. Edit the result → change category → save → verify success banner
    17. Try entering invalid URL → verify validation rejects it
    18. Delete test result → verify success banner

    **Public pages:**
    19. Visit http://localhost:3000/shows — verify public page loads with Supabase data
    20. Visit http://localhost:3000/sponsors — verify public page loads
    21. Visit http://localhost:3000/results — verify public page loads

    **Auth protection:**
    22. Open incognito window → visit http://localhost:3000/admin → verify redirect to login
