**Tech stack available:**
- Next.js 16.1.6 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with dark western theme
- TypeScript
- @heroicons/react/24/outline
- next/font/google (Montserrat + Inter)

**Established UI patterns (from Phase 3):**
- Full-bleed hero with Image + gradient overlay
- Section contrast (alternating bg-navy-800/bg-navy-900)
- Card/link grids with responsive columns
- External links with target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
- Icon usage for visual cues

**Constraining decisions:**
- Typography classes from Phase 01-02
- Always-dark mode
- Hero pattern with full-bleed background
- Gold accent color (gold-500) for highlights

**Available results data (from src/data/shows.ts):**
- `resultsLinks` array: 6 links (2025 results, 2024 year-end, 2024 results, 2024 Patriot results, 2023 photos, GAG standings)
- `resultsProviders` object: White Horse Show Management and Tracy Devenport Photography with URLs

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create /results page with hero and results links display</name>
  <files>src/app/results/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Create Next.js page at /results with full-bleed hero pattern (same as shows page - relative container + next/image fill + gradient overlay) with western-themed background. Hero title "Results & Standings", subtitle about accessing show results and year-end champions. Below hero, create results section (bg-navy-900 py-16) with heading "Show Results & Standings". Map over resultsLinks array from shows.ts to render results links in organized grid or list. Group links logically: current year results at top, past year results/champions, then GAG standings. Each link displayed as card or button (bg-navy-800 border border-gold-500/20 p-4 rounded-lg hover:border-gold-500 transition) with link label, appropriate icon (TrophyIcon for champions, DocumentTextIcon for results PDFs, CameraIcon for photos, ChartBarIcon for standings), and external link indicator. All links are external, use target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer". Add metadata export with title "Results & Standings | SMRHA" and description.</action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, visit /results shows hero and 6 result links organized clearly, all links clickable and open externally, responsive layout works</verify>
  <done>Results page renders with hero, all 6 result links from resultsLinks array display with proper grouping and icons, external links work correctly, build passes</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add results providers section and live results information</name>
  <files>src/app/results/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Below results links section, add "Results Provided By" section (bg-navy-800 py-12) displaying the two providers from resultsProviders object (White Horse Show Management and Tracy Devenport Photography). Show each provider with name as heading-3 and URL as clickable link with ArrowTopRightOnSquareIcon. Below providers, add "Live Results" informational section (bg-navy-900 py-12) explaining that live results are posted during shows via White Horse Show Management and TD Photo links, and final results/standings are published after each event. Include call-to-action text encouraging members to check back after shows for updated standings. Maintain consistent dark western styling throughout.</action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, providers section shows White Horse and TD Photo with clickable links, live results info section displays with clear messaging</verify>
  <done>Providers section displays both result providers with working links, live results information section provides context about when/where to find results, all styling matches theme, build passes</done>
</task>
