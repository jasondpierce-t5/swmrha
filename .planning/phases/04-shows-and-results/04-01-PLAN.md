**Tech stack available:**
- Next.js 16.1.6 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS v4 with dark western theme (@theme inline tokens)
- TypeScript
- @heroicons/react/24/outline
- next/font/google (Montserrat + Inter)

**Established UI patterns (from Phase 3):**
- Full-bleed hero: `relative h-[400px]` container + `Image fill` + dark gradient overlay + `z-10` content
- Section contrast: alternating `bg-navy-800` / `bg-navy-900` for visual rhythm
- Card grids: responsive columns (1/2/3 based on viewport)
- Icons from @heroicons/react/24/outline for visual cues
- External links open in new tab with `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`

**Constraining decisions:**
- Phase 01-02: Typography classes (.text-heading-1/2/3) bundle font + size + weight + family
- Phase 01-02: Always-dark mode (no light theme)
- Phase 03-01: Hero pattern with full-bleed Image + dark gradient ensures text readability
- Phase 03-01: Responsive breakpoints at md (768px) for 2-column, lg for 3-column

**Available show data (from src/data/shows.ts):**
- 2 events in `showSchedule` array (Route 66 Slide, Patriot Slide)
- Each event has: name, subtitle, dates, location, venue, links array, optional notes
- Venue object: Lucky J Arena and Steakhouse, Carthage, MO
- Event links include: Show Bill (PDF), Stall/RV Reservation, Warm-Up Reservation, Online Entries, Results, Photos/Video

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create /shows page with hero and show schedule cards</name>
  <files>src/app/shows/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Create Next.js page at /shows displaying upcoming show schedule. Use full-bleed hero pattern (relative container + next/image fill + dark gradient overlay) with western-themed background image from images manifest. Hero title "2025 Show Schedule" (from shows.ts pageTitle), subtitle about SMRHA's premier reining events. Below hero, create show schedule section with dark bg-navy-900. Map over showSchedule array to render event cards in responsive grid (1 column mobile, 2 columns md+). Each card (bg-navy-800 border border-gold-500/20 p-6 rounded-lg): event name as heading-2, subtitle in gold-500, dates with CalendarDaysIcon, location with MapPinIcon, venue name, and links list (each link as button or styled anchor - internal links use next/link, external links use target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"). If event has notes array, display below links in italic text-sm. Use @heroicons/react/24/outline for icons. Follow Phase 3 spacing and typography patterns. Add metadata export with title "Show Schedule | SMRHA" and description about upcoming reining shows.</action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, visit /shows in browser shows hero with 2 event cards, all links clickable, responsive grid works on mobile/desktop</verify>
  <done>Shows page renders with hero, 2 event cards (Route 66 Slide, Patriot Slide), all event details (dates, location, links) display correctly, external links open in new tab, build passes without errors</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add venue information and entry instructions sections</name>
  <files>src/app/shows/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Below the show schedule cards section, add venue information section (bg-navy-800 py-16). Display venue.name and venue.location from shows.ts in centered text with heading styling. Below venue section, add entry information section (bg-navy-900 py-16) with heading "How to Enter" and instructional content: explain that entries open via links on each show card, mention online entries through White Horse Show Management, reference show bills for complete class lists and rules, include stall/RV reservation process, and note warm-up reservation system. Use prose-style paragraphs with appropriate spacing. Add BuildingStorefrontIcon or TicketIcon for visual interest. Ensure all sections maintain dark western aesthetic with gold accent colors.</action>
  <verify>npm run build succeeds, venue section displays Lucky J Arena info, entry instructions section renders with clear guidance, all typography follows theme patterns</verify>
  <done>Venue section shows arena name and location, entry instructions section provides clear guidance on how to enter shows, all sections maintain consistent dark western styling, build passes</done>
