<objective>
Audit and improve accessibility to ensure the site is usable by people with disabilities and meets WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

Purpose: Make the site accessible to all users including those using screen readers, keyboard navigation, and assistive technologies.
Output: Accessibility report with findings, fixes applied for critical issues, verified keyboard navigation.

**Tech stack available:**
- Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS v4 (dark theme)
- Heroicons for icons
- All pages built (Phases 3-6)

**Key context:**
- Dark western theme (needs contrast verification)
- Desktop navigation with hover dropdowns
- Mobile navigation with hamburger menu
- All content pages complete with various UI patterns (cards, grids, tables, links)

**Established patterns:**
- Header/Footer in layout
- Hero sections on most pages
- Card grids for content
- Clickable tel: and mailto: links

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Audit semantic HTML and add missing ARIA labels</name>
  <files>May modify: src/components/Header.tsx, src/components/Footer.tsx, src/app/page.tsx, other page files if needed</files>
  <action>
    Perform accessibility audit focusing on:

    1. **Semantic HTML structure:**
       - Verify proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skipping levels)
       - Check that navigation uses `<nav>` element
       - Verify main content in `<main>` (already in layout.tsx)
       - Check footer uses `<footer>` element

    2. **ARIA labels for interactive elements:**
       - Mobile menu toggle button needs aria-label="Menu" and aria-expanded state
       - Navigation dropdowns need aria-haspopup and aria-expanded
       - External links should have aria-label indicating "opens in new tab"
       - Icon-only buttons need descriptive aria-labels

    3. **Image alt text:**
       - Verify all `<Image>` components have meaningful alt text
       - Decorative images should have alt="" (empty string)
       - Logo images should describe the organization

    4. **Form labels (if contact form exists):**
       - All form inputs have associated `<label>` elements or aria-label
       - Error messages are associated with inputs via aria-describedby

    5. **Color contrast:**
       - Verify text meets WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
       - Check gold-500 text on dark backgrounds
       - Use browser DevTools or WebAIM contrast checker

    Fix any critical issues found (missing ARIA labels, insufficient contrast, broken heading hierarchy). Document findings in summary.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Run axe DevTools extension or Lighthouse accessibility audit in Chrome DevTools
    - Verify no critical accessibility violations
    - Check that mobile menu toggle has aria-label and aria-expanded
    - Verify heading hierarchy is logical (use browser DevTools to inspect)
  </verify>
  <done>Accessibility audit complete. Critical issues fixed (ARIA labels added, contrast issues resolved if any, semantic HTML verified). Audit results documented.</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Accessibility improvements and keyboard navigation support</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility:

    1. **Start dev server:** `npm run dev`
    2. **Keyboard navigation test:**
       - Use Tab key to navigate through all interactive elements
       - Verify visible focus indicators on links, buttons, dropdowns
       - Test Enter/Space to activate buttons and links
       - Test Escape to close mobile menu and dropdowns
       - Verify logical tab order (top to bottom, left to right)

    3. **Screen reader test (optional but recommended):**
       - Windows: Enable Narrator (Win+Ctrl+Enter)
       - macOS: Enable VoiceOver (Cmd+F5)
       - Navigate with screen reader, verify ARIA labels are announced
       - Confirm navigation structure is clear

    4. **Mobile menu accessibility:**
       - Open mobile menu (hamburger icon)
       - Verify aria-expanded changes state
       - Close with Escape key
       - Verify focus is trapped within open menu

    5. **Contrast check:**
       - Verify gold-500 text is readable on dark backgrounds
       - Check hover states have sufficient contrast
       - Confirm link colors meet WCAG AA standards

    **Expected results:**
    - All interactive elements reachable via keyboard
    - Focus indicators visible on all elements
    - ARIA labels properly announced by screen readers
    - No keyboard traps (can navigate in and out of all sections)
    - Logical reading order maintained
