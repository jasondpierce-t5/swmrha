<objective>
Build the About page with mission/history narrative, officers and board of directors grid with role cards, and open invitation — establishing the organization's credibility and human connection.

Purpose: The About page builds trust by showing who runs SWMRHA and why it exists. Officers with roles/contact info demonstrate a real, active organization.
Output: Fully styled About page at `/about` using extracted data and established theme.

**Tech stack available:** Next.js 16.1.6, Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript, Montserrat + Inter fonts, @heroicons/react
**Established patterns:**
- Color: bg-navy-800 body, bg-navy-700 cards, bg-navy-900 footer/contrast sections, border-navy-600 dividers
- Accents: gold-500 for CTAs/highlights, teal-500 for links/secondary
- Text: text-white primary, text-slate-300 secondary, text-slate-400 muted
- Typography: font-heading for headings, font-body for body; .text-heading-1/2/3 classes
- Cards: bg-navy-700 rounded-card border border-navy-600
- Data: import from '@/data' barrel export
- Server components by default (no 'use client' unless interactive)

**Constraining decisions:**
- [02-01]: about.ts has mission (2 paragraphs), boardMembers (4 from "Friends of The SMRHA"), openInvitation
- [02-02]: contact.ts has officers (7 with roles, phones, emails)
- [02-01]: No board member photos exist — noted in about.ts comment
- [01-03]: Layout adds pt for fixed header automatically
- Follow page section patterns established in 03-01 (home page)

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build mission section and officers/board grid</name>
  <files>src/app/about/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Replace the placeholder About page with a full-featured page. Build these sections:

**Page header / Mission section:**
- Section py-16 lg:py-24 with container max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4
- Page title "About SWMRHA" as text-heading-1 text-center text-white mb-4
- Subtle subtitle "Promoting the Sport of Reining at the Grassroots Level" in text-gold-500 text-center font-heading mb-12
- mission paragraphs (from about.ts) rendered as text-lg text-slate-300 leading-relaxed with space-y-6
- openInvitation (from about.ts) as italic text-slate-400 mt-8 border-l-4 border-gold-500 pl-6 (blockquote style)

**Officers & Board section:**
- Section bg-navy-900 py-16 lg:py-24 for visual contrast
- Container max-w-6xl mx-auto px-4
- Heading "Officers & Board Members" as text-heading-1 text-center text-white mb-4
- Subtitle from contact.ts (subtitle: "Officers and Board Members are here to help you!") as text-slate-400 text-center mb-12
- Grid: grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-6
- Each officer card (bg-navy-700 rounded-card border border-navy-600 p-6 text-center):
  - Placeholder avatar: div w-20 h-20 rounded-full bg-navy-600 mx-auto mb-4 flex items-center justify-center, with UserCircleIcon from @heroicons/react/24/solid (w-12 h-12 text-slate-500)
  - Name as font-heading font-semibold text-white text-lg
  - Role as text-gold-500 text-sm font-medium uppercase tracking-wide
  - Phone as text-slate-400 text-sm mt-2 (display as-is, linked with tel: href)
  - Email if exists as text-teal-500 text-sm hover:text-teal-400 (linked with mailto:)

**"Friends of The SMRHA" section (after officers):**
- Container max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-16
- Heading "Friends of The SMRHA" as text-heading-2 text-center text-gold-500 mb-8
- Board members from about.ts rendered in a centered flex-wrap row of name badges (bg-navy-700 rounded-full px-6 py-3 border border-navy-600 font-heading text-white)

Import officers from '@/data/contact', mission/boardMembers/openInvitation from '@/data/about', subtitle from '@/data/contact'.
Use UserCircleIcon from @heroicons/react/24/solid for avatar placeholders — server-component safe.
Do NOT add 'use client'.

Export metadata for SEO: title "About - SWMRHA" and description about the organization.

  <verify>npm run build passes without errors; visiting localhost:3000/about shows mission text, officers grid with role cards, and Friends section</verify>
  <done>About page renders mission/history section, 7 officer cards with roles/phones/emails in responsive grid, and Friends of The SMRHA name badges. Phone numbers are clickable tel: links, emails are clickable mailto: links. Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors.</done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete About page with mission narrative, officers grid, and Friends section</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: npm run dev
    2. Visit: http://localhost:3000/about
    3. Desktop (>1024px): Verify mission text is readable and well-spaced. Officers grid shows 4 columns with placeholder avatars, names, roles in gold, phone numbers, and emails (where available). Friends section shows name badges in a row.
    4. Tablet (768px): Officers grid 2 columns, Friends badges wrap
    5. Mobile (375px): Officers single column, all text legible
    6. Click a phone number — should trigger phone dialer (or show tel: link)
    7. Click an email — should open email client (or show mailto: link)
    8. Navigate from About back to Home via header nav — confirm both pages work
    9. Confirm: Consistent dark western aesthetic matching home page
