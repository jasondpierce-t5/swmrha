# Roadmap: SWMRHA Website Rebuild

## Overview

A ground-up rebuild of the SWMRHA website from a downloaded Wix site to a modern Next.js 14+ application. The journey starts with project foundation and theme, extracts all real content from the existing site, builds out each page group with a dark western-professional aesthetic inspired by NRHA.com, and culminates in a polished, deployed MVP on Vercel that proves the Wix era is over.
